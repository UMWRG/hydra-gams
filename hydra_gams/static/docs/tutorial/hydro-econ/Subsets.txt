* Define further subsets to simplify model formulation equations
*        in this case the subsets are aggregations of subsets of i (nodes)

Sets
         stor(i) storage nodes (e.g. reservoirs. aquifers or large desal sources)
         managedstor(i) managed storage nodes (reservoirs and aquifers but not desal)
         nonstor(i) non storage nodes (e.g. junctions. demand nodes. etc.)
         dem(i) demand nodes (e.g. urban and agricultural demands) ;

         stor(i) = sr(i) + gw(i) + desal(i);
         managedstor(i) = sr(i) + gw(i);

*        subset contains all nonstorage nodes
         nonstor(i) = not stor(i) ;

         dem(i) = ur(i) + ag(i) ;
